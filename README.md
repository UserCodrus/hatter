## What Am I Looking At Here?
The world's most useless social media app, Hatter.

Like the Hatter's tea parties from Alice in Wonderland, Hatter forces every user to switch accounts at midnight UTC.

## How Do I Build This Nonsense Myself?
Just `npm install` to install dependencies then `npm run dev` to start the dev server.
